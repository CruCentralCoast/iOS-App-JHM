# LocationPicker

`LocationPickerViewController` is a `UIViewController` subclass to let users choose locations by searching or selecting on map.
It's designed to work as `UIImagePickerController`.

User can select location either by searching or long pressing on map. In both cases you'll receive CLPlacemark, which contains location coordinates as well as information such as the country, state, city, street address, and POI names.

## Usage

Create a new instance in code (`LocationPickerViewController()`) or by setting class of `UIViewController` in Storyboard.
Then provide completion block which will be called when user closes view controller.

```swift
let locationPicker = LocationPickerViewController()

// you can optionally set initial location
let location = CLLocation(latitude: 35, longitude: 35)
let initialLocation = Location(name: "My home", location: location)
locationPicker.location = initialLocation

// button placed on right bottom corner
locationPicker.showCurrentLocationButton = true // default: true

// default: navigation bar's `barTintColor` or `.whiteColor()`
locationPicker.currentLocationButtonBackground = .blueColor()

// ignored if initial location is given, shows that location instead
locationPicker.showCurrentLocationInitially = true // default: true

locationPicker.mapType = .Standard // default: .Hybrid

// for searching, see `MKLocalSearchRequest`'s `region` property
locationPicker.useCurrentLocationAsHint = true // default: false

locationPicker.searchBarPlaceholder = "Search places" // default: "Search or enter an address"

locationPicker.searchHistoryLabel = "Previously searched" // default: "Search History"

// optional region distance to be used for creation region when user selects place from search results
locationPicker.resultRegionDistance = 500 // default: 600

locationPicker.completion = { location in
    // do some awesome stuff with location
}

navigationController?.pushViewController(locationPicker, animated: true)
```
